Using replace to generate source files
======================================

Here we illustrate how you can use [replace][] and [createFile][] to
generate files, much like `AC_SUBST` and `AC_CONFIG_FILES` in autoconf.

In this example, we'll use the silly module name `Distribution.Simple` to
illustrate that franchise (quire properly). prefers to use local source
code rather than modules located in a package.

[replace]: haddock/Distribution-Franchise-V1.html#v%3Areplace
[createFile]: haddock/Distribution-Franchise-V1.html#v%3AcreateFile

~~~~ tests/replace/Distribution/Simple.hs.in
module Distribution.Simple where
foo = putStrLn @Foo@
~~~~

~~~~ tests/replace/simple.hs
import Distribution.Simple
main = foo
~~~~

As you can see, it's just a standard hello world.

Setup.hs
--------


~~~~ tests/replace/Setup.hs
import Distribution.Franchise.V1

main = build [] $
       do replace "@Foo@" "Foo message"
          createFile "Distribution/Simple.hs"
          executable "simple" "simple.hs" []
~~~~

Testing it out
--------------

~~~~ tests/replace/replace.sh
set -ev
runghc Setup.hs build
./simple
./simple | grep 'Foo message'
~~~~
