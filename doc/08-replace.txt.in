Using replace to generate source files
======================================

Here we illustrate how you can use [replace][] to modify files, much like
`AC_SUBST` in autoconf.

[replace]: haddock/Distribution-Franchise.html#v%3Areplace

file: tests/replace/Foo.hs.in
    module Foo where
    foo = putStrLn @Foo@

file: tests/replace/simple.hs
    import Foo
    main = foo

As you can see, it's just a standard hello world.

Setup.hs
--------


file: tests/replace/Setup.hs
    import Distribution.Franchise
    
    main = build [] (do replace "@Foo@" "Foo message"
                        createFile "Foo.hs")
           (executable "simple" "simple.hs" [])

Testing it out
--------------

file: tests/replace/replace.sh
....set -ev
    runghc Setup.hs build
...../simple
    ./simple | grep 'Foo message'
