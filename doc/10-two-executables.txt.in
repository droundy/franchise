Two executables
===============

Sometimes you might want to build two executables.

file: tests/two-executables/hello.hs
    main = putStrLn "hello world"

file: tests/two-executables/goodbye.hs
    main = putStrLn "goodbye world"

Setup.hs
--------

This couldn't be easier.  You just need to indicate how to build them, and
then return a list with two elements:

file: tests/two-executables/Setup.hs
    import Distribution.Franchise
    
    main = build [] (return ()) $
           do executable "hello" "hello.hs" []
              executable "goodbye" "goodbye.hs" []
              return ["hello","goodbye"]

Testing it out
--------------

file: tests/two-executables/two-executables.sh
....set -ev
    runghc Setup.hs build
    ./hello
    ./goodbye
