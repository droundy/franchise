Two executables
===============

Sometimes you might want to build two executables.

~~~~ tests/two-executables/hello.hs
main = putStrLn "hello world"
~~~~

~~~~ tests/two-executables/goodbye.hs
main = putStrLn "goodbye world"
~~~~

Setup.hs
--------

This couldn't be easier.  You just need to indicate how to build them, and
then return a list with two elements:

~~~~ tests/two-executables/Setup.hs
import Distribution.Franchise

main = build [] (return ()) $
       do executable "hello" "hello.hs" []
          executable "goodbye" "goodbye.hs" []
          return ["hello","goodbye"]
~~~~

Testing it out
--------------

~~~~ tests/two-executables/two-executables.sh
set -ev
runghc Setup.hs build
./hello
./goodbye
~~~~
