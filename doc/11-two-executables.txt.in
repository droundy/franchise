Two executables
===============

Sometimes you might want to build two executables.

~~~~ tests/two-executables/hello.hs
main = putStrLn "hello world"
~~~~

~~~~ tests/two-executables/goodbye.hs
main = putStrLn "goodbye world"
~~~~

Setup.hs
--------

This couldn't be easier.  You just need to indicate how to build them.

~~~~ tests/two-executables/Setup.hs
import Distribution.Franchise.V1

main = build [] $
       do executable "hello" "hello.hs" []
          executable "goodbye" "goodbye.hs" []
~~~~

Testing it out
--------------

~~~~ tests/two-executables/two-executables.sh
set -ev
runghc Setup.hs build
./hello
./goodbye

if which jhc; then
  # we have jhc, so we should be able to compile with it!
  runghc Setup.hs distclean
  runghc Setup.hs build --jhc
  ./hello
  ./goodbye
else
  echo we can not test with jhc here
fi
