Building both a package and an executable
=========================================

Sometimes you might want to build both a package and one or more
executables.

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/Hello.hs
module Hello where
hello = "hello world"
~~~~

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/Greet.hs
module Greet where
greet = putStrLn
~~~~

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/hello-world.hs
import Hello
import Greet
main = greet hello
~~~~

Setup.hs
--------

This couldn't be much easier.  You just need to indicate how to build
them, specifying the package first.

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/Setup.hs
import Distribution.Franchise.V1

main = build [] $ do version "1.0"
                     package "hello" ["Hello"] []
                     executable "hello" "hello-world.hs" []
~~~~

Testing it out
--------------

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/package-and-executable.sh
set -ev

echo GHC_PACKAGE_PATH is $GHC_PACKAGE_PATH

runghc Setup.hs install build --prefix=$HOME/local

cat franchise.log
grep Hello.hs franchise.log
# we should only compile Hello.hs once.
#grep Hello.hs franchise.log | wc -l > numHello
#grep 1 numHello
#ls -l Hello.hi && exit 1 # Check that we didn't create a Hello.hi outside dist/
./hello
./hello | grep 'hello world'

runghc Setup.hs uninstall

if ! which jhc; then
  echo we can not test on jhc as it is not available
  exit 0
fi

# we have jhc, so we should be able to compile with it!
runghc Setup.hs distclean
runghc Setup.hs configure --jhc
runghc Setup.hs build
test -f hello-1.0.hl
./hello
