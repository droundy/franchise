Building both a package and an executable
=========================================

Sometimes you might want to build both a package and one or more
executables.

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/Hello.hs
module Hello where
hello = putStrLn "hello world"
~~~~

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/hello.hs
import Hello
main = hello
~~~~

Setup.hs
--------

This couldn't be much easier.  You just need to indicate how to build
them---being careful to mention the package first---and then return a list
with two elements:

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/Setup.hs
import Distribution.Franchise

main = build [] $
       do p <- package "hello" ["Hello"] []
          e <- executable "hello" "hello.hs" []
          return (p++e)
~~~~

Testing it out
--------------

~~~~ tests/package-and-executable/package-and-executable.sh
set -ev
runghc Setup.hs build --debug
./hello
~~~~
