Another simple executable
=========================

Here's code to produce a simple executable.  First we have the actual
source code to the executable:

\begin{file}{tests/second/second.hs}
import Data.List

main = putStrLn "hello world"
\end{file}

As you can see, it's just a standard hello world with a useless import
statement for excitement.

Setup.hs
--------

The ``Setup.hs`` file is given below, which is pretty simple.

\begin{file}{tests/second/Setup.hs}
import Distribution.Franchise

main = build [] (return ())
       (executable "second" "second.hs" [])

\end{file}

Testing it out
--------------

And here's how we actually build the program.  As you can see, users
don't actually need to run configure unless they are unhappy with the
defaults.

\begin{file}{tests/second/second.sh}
set -ev
# hokey workaround...
ln -s ../../../Distribution .

runghc Setup.hs build

./second

\end{file}
