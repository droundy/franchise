Franchise
=========

Franchise is an easy-to use package for building Haskell software. Unlike
Cabal, you aren't required to track every possible dependency in every
possible build condition. Nor are you required to use an
external tool such as autoconf in order to configure the build based on
which packages, libraries and tools are present.  Instead, you need
only provide the information that is needed in order to build your
package.

## Manual and test suite

For more information, see the [manual and test
suite](doc/manual/index.html).

In addition, there is the [haddock documentation of the franchise
API](doc/manual/haddock/index.html).
