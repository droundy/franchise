Franchise
=========

Franchise is an easy-to use package for building Haskell software. Unlike
Cabal, you aren't required to track every possible dependency in every
possible build condition. In addition, you are not required to use an
external tool such as autoconf in order to configure the build based on
which packages, libraries and tools are present.

## Manual and test suite

For more information, see the [rudimentary manual and test
suite](doc/manual/index.html).
