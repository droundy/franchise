Using franchise
===============

This is the beginning of a manual for franchise.  It consists of several
small pages describing certain aspects of franchise, each of which doubles
as a test in the test suite.

To add new tests (or equivalently, new documentation), just add a new file
`doc/filename.text.in`, and when the documentation is rebuilt, it will
appear in this index.  Currently there is not yet a mechanism for ordering
of documentation...
