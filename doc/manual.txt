Using franchise
===============

Franchise itself is a library for writing configure/build scripts.
This manual is goal-oriented, rather than API-oriented, meaning that
we discuss how to achieve goals you might have, introducing functions
as they are needed.  At the same time, we give scripts demonstrating
how the resulting `Setup.hs` scripts behave.  For an API-oriented
look, see the [haddock documentation](haddock/index.html).

In general, franchise scripts behave analogously to configure scripts
generated by `autoconf`, except that they are capable not only of
configuring your program, but also of building it, so a one sense,
franchise scripts serve as a combination of a configure script with a
makefile.
