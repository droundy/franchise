Using franchise
===============

This is the beginning of a manual for franchise.  It consists of several
small pages describing certain aspects of franchise, each of which doubles
as a test in the test suite.

Adding new documentation
------------------------

To add new tests (or equivalently, new documentation), just add a new file
`doc/filename.text.in`, and when the documentation is rebuilt, it will
appear in this index.  The documentation is generated in the lexigraphic
order according to file names.  To this end, I've prefixed the files with
two-digit sequences.  Please try to arrange it so the more readable docs
are at the beginning of the list.

Links to the actual documentation
---------------------------------

Here are the actual docs.  I'm trying to arrange things in a reasonable
order, so you can read the links one at a time and learn to use franchise.
Ultimately, we should haddock the sources and link into the haddock from
here.

Franchise itself is a library for writing configure/build scripts.  This
manual is goal-oriented, rather than API-oriented, meaning that we discuss
how to achieve goals you might have, introducing functions as they are
needed.  At the same time, we give scripts demonstrating how the resulting
`Setup.hs` scripts behave.

In general, franchise scripts behave analogously to configure scripts
generated by `autoconf`, except that they are capable not only of
configuring your program, but also of building it, so a one sense,
franchise scripts serve as a combination of a configure script with a
makefile.
