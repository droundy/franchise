A simple executable
===================

Here's code to produce a very simple executable.

\begin{file}{tests/simple-executable/simple-executable.hs}
main = return ()
\end{file}

Here's the ``Setup.hs`` file.

\begin{file}{tests/simple-executable/Setup.hs}
import Distribution.Franchise

main = build [] (return ())
       (executable "simple-executable" "simple-executable.hs" [])
\end{file}

And finally we'll test that this executable actually builds and runs.

\begin{file}{tests/simple-executable/simple-executable.sh}
set -ev
# hokey workaround...
ln -sf ../../../Distribution .

runghc Setup.hs build

./simple-executable
\end{file}
