A simple executable
====================

Here's code to produce a simple executable.  First we have the actual
source code to the executable:

file: tests/simple/simple.hs
    import Data.List
    
    main = putStrLn "hello world"

As you can see, it's just a standard hello world with a useless import
statement for excitement.

Setup.hs
--------

The ``Setup.hs`` file is given below, which is pretty simple.

file: tests/simple/Setup.hs
    import Distribution.Franchise
    
    main = build [] (return ())
           (executable "simple" "simple.hs" [])

Testing it out
--------------

And here's how we actually build the program.  As you can see, users
don't actually need to run configure unless they are unhappy with the
defaults.

file: tests/simple/simple.sh
....set -ev
....# hokey workaround...
....ln -sf ../../../Distribution .
....
    runghc Setup.hs build
    ./simple
